<p>
 If there is a security manager, its <code dir="ltr" translate="no">checkConnect</code>
 method is called for each InetAddress. Only InetAddresses where
 the <code dir="ltr" translate="no">checkConnect</code> doesn't throw a SecurityException
 will be returned in the Enumeration. However, if the caller has the
 <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/java/net/NetPermission">NetPermission</a></code>("getNetworkInformation") permission, then all
 InetAddresses are returned.</p>
