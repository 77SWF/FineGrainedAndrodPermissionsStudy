<p>Checks if the specified app can modify system settings. As of API
 level 23, an app cannot modify system settings unless it declares the
 <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/Manifest.permission#WRITE_SETTINGS">Manifest.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS</a></code>
 permission in its manifest, <em>and</em> the user specifically grants
 the app this capability. To prompt the user to grant this approval,
 the app must send an intent with the action <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/provider/Settings#ACTION_MANAGE_WRITE_SETTINGS">Settings.ACTION_MANAGE_WRITE_SETTINGS</a></code>, which causes
 the system to display a permission management screen.</p>
