<p>Once opened successfully, the database is cached, so you can
 call this method every time you need to write to the database.
 (Make sure to call <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteOpenHelper#close()">close()</a></code> when you no longer need the database.)
 Errors such as bad permissions or a full disk may cause this method
 to fail, but future attempts may succeed if the problem is fixed.</p>
