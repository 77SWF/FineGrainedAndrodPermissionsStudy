 <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/app/AuthenticationRequiredException">AuthenticationRequiredException</a></code> can be thrown if user does not have
 sufficient permission for the linked document. Before any new permissions
 are granted for the linked document, a visible UI must be shown, so the
 user can explicitly confirm whether the permission grants are expected.
 The user must be able to cancel the operation.
 </p><p>
 Options passed as an argument may include a list of recipients, such
 as email addresses. The provider should reflect these options if possible,
 but it's acceptable to ignore them. In either case, confirmation UI must
 be shown before any new permission grants are granted.

 It is all right to generate a web link without granting new permissions,
 if opening the link would result in a page for requesting permission
 access. If it's impossible then the operation must fail by throwing an exception.</p>
