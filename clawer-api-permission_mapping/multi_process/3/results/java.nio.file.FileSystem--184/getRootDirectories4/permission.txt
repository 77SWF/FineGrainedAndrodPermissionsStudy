<p> When a security manager is installed, it is invoked to check access
 to the each root directory. If denied, the root directory is not returned
 by the iterator. In the case of the default provider, the <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/java/lang/SecurityManager#checkRead(java.lang.String)">SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)</a></code> method is invoked to check read access
 to each root directory. It is system dependent if the permission checks
 are done when the iterator is obtained or during iteration.</p>
