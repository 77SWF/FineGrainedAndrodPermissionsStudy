<p>Set whether a subscription is opportunistic, that is, whether the network it connects
 to has limited coverage. For example, CBRS. Setting a subscription opportunistic has
 following impacts:
  1) Even if it's active, it will be dormant most of the time. The modem will not try
     to scan or camp until it knows an available network is nearby to save power.
  2) Telephony relies on system app or carrier input to notify nearby available networks.
     See <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager#updateAvailableNetworks(java.util.List&lt;android.telephony.AvailableNetworkInfo&gt;,%20java.util.concurrent.Executor,%20java.util.function.Consumer&lt;java.lang.Integer&gt;)">TelephonyManager#updateAvailableNetworks(List, Executor, Consumer)</a></code>
     for more information.
  3) In multi-SIM devices, when the network is nearby and camped, system may automatically
     switch internet data between it and default data subscription, based on carrier
     recommendation and its signal strength and metered-ness, etc.


 Caller will either have <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/Manifest.permission#MODIFY_PHONE_STATE">Manifest.permission.MODIFY_PHONE_STATE</a></code> or carrier
 privilege permission of the subscription.
