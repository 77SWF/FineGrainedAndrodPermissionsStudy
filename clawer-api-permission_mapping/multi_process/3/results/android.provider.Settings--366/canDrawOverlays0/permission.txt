<p>Checks if the specified context can draw on top of other apps. As of API
 level 23, an app cannot draw on top of other apps unless it declares the
 <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/Manifest.permission#SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW">Manifest.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW</a></code> permission in its
 manifest, <em>and</em> the user specifically grants the app this
 capability. To prompt the user to grant this approval, the app must send an
 intent with the action
 <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/provider/Settings#ACTION_MANAGE_OVERLAY_PERMISSION">ACTION_MANAGE_OVERLAY_PERMISSION</a></code>, which
 causes the system to display a permission management screen.</p>
