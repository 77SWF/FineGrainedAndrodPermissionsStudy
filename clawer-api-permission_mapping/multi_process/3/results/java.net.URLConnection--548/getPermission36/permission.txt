<p>Returns a permission object representing the permission
 necessary to make the connection represented by this
 object. This method returns null if no permission is
 required to make the connection. By default, this method
 returns <code dir="ltr" translate="no">java.security.AllPermission</code>. Subclasses
 should override this method and return the permission
 that best represents the permission required to make a
 a connection to the URL. For example, a <code dir="ltr" translate="no">URLConnection</code>
 representing a <code dir="ltr" translate="no">file:</code> URL would return a
 <code dir="ltr" translate="no">java.io.FilePermission</code> object.

 </p><p>The permission returned may dependent upon the state of the
 connection. For example, the permission before connecting may be
 different from that after connecting. For example, an HTTP
 sever, say foo.com, may redirect the connection to a different
 host, say bar.com. Before connecting the permission returned by
 the connection will represent the permission needed to connect
 to foo.com, while the permission returned after connecting will
 be to bar.com.

 </p><p>Permissions are generally used for two purposes: to protect
 caches of objects obtained through URLConnections, and to check
 the right of a recipient to learn about a particular URL. In
 the first case, the permission should be obtained
 <em>after</em> the object has been obtained. For example, in an
 HTTP connection, this will represent the permission to connect
 to the host from which the data was ultimately fetched. In the
 second case, the permission should be obtained and tested
 <em>before</em> connecting.</p><table class="responsive">
