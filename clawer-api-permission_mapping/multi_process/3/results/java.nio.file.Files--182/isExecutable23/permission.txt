<p>Tests whether a file is executable. This method checks that a file exists
 and that this Java virtual machine has appropriate privileges to <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/java/lang/Runtime#exec(java.lang.String)">execute</a></code> the file. The semantics may differ when checking
 access to a directory. For example, on UNIX systems, checking for
 execute access checks that the Java virtual machine has permission to
 search the directory in order to access file or subdirectories.

 </p><p> Depending on the implementation, this method may require to read file
 permissions, access control lists, or other file attributes in order to
 check the effective access to the file. Consequently, this method may not
 be atomic with respect to other file system operations.
