<p>Returns the ICC ID.

 Starting with API level 29 Security Patch 2021-04-05, returns the ICC ID if the calling app
 has been granted the READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE permission, has carrier privileges (see
 <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager#hasCarrierPrivileges()">TelephonyManager#hasCarrierPrivileges</a></code>), or is a device owner or profile owner that
 has been granted the READ_PHONE_STATE permission. The profile owner is an app that owns a
 managed profile on the device; for more details see <a href="https://developer.android.google.cn/work/managed-profiles">Work profiles</a>. Profile
 owner access is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.</p>
