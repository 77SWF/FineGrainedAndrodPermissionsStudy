<p>Returns the permissions for the given codesource object.
 The implementation of this method first calls super.getPermissions
 and then adds permissions based on the URL of the codesource.
 </p><p>
 If the protocol of this URL is "jar", then the permission granted
 is based on the permission that is required by the URL of the Jar
 file.
 </p><p>
 If the protocol is "file" and there is an authority component, then
 permission to connect to and accept connections from that authority
 may be granted. If the protocol is "file"
 and the path specifies a file, then permission to read that
 file is granted. If protocol is "file" and the path is
 a directory, permission is granted to read all files
 and (recursively) all files and subdirectories contained in
 that directory.
 </p><p>
 If the protocol is not "file", then permission
 to connect to and accept connections from the URL's host is granted.</p><table class="responsive">
