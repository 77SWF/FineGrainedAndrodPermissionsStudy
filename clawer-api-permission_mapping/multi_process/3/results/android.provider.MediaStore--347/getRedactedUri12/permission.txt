 A redacted Uri can be used to share a file with another application wherein exposing
 sensitive information in EXIF headers is not desirable.
 Note:
 1. Redacted uris cannot be granted write access and can neither be used to perform any kind
 of write operations.
 2. To get a redacted uri the caller must hold read permission to <code dir="ltr" translate="no">uri</code>.</p>
