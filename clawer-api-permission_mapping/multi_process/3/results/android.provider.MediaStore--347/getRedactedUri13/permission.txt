<p>
 A redacted Uri can be used to share a file with another application wherein exposing
 sensitive information in EXIF headers is not desirable.
 Note:
 1. Order of the returned uris follow the order of the <code dir="ltr" translate="no">uris</code>.
 2. Redacted uris cannot be granted write access and can neither be used to perform any kind
 of write operations.
 3. To get a redacted uri the caller must hold read permission to its corresponding uri.</p>
