<p>
 Even although the new logger is anonymous, it is configured
 to have the root logger ("") as its parent.  This means that
 by default it inherits its effective level and handlers
 from the root logger.  Changing its parent via the
 <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/java/util/logging/Logger#setParent(java.util.logging.Logger)">setParent</a></code> method
 will still require the security permission specified by that method.
