 Instances of NetworkCapabilities sent to apps without the appropriate permissions will have
 this field cleared out.

 <p>
 This field will only be populated for VPN and wifi network suggestor apps (i.e using
 <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiNetworkSuggestion">WifiNetworkSuggestion</a></code>), and only for the
 network they own. In the case of wifi network suggestors apps, this field is also location
 sensitive, so the app needs to hold <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION">Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</a></code>
 permission. If the app targets SDK version greater than or equal to
 <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES#S">Build.VERSION_CODES#S</a></code>, then they also need to use
 <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/net/ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback#FLAG_INCLUDE_LOCATION_INFO">NetworkCallback#FLAG_INCLUDE_LOCATION_INFO</a></code> to get the info in their callback. If the
 apps targets SDK version equal to {<code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES#R">Build.VERSION_CODES#R</a></code>, this field will always be
 included. The app will be blamed for location access if this field is included.
