<p>Remove permissions to access a particular content provider Uri
 that were previously added with <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/app/slice/SliceManager#grantSlicePermission(java.lang.String,%20android.net.Uri)">grantSlicePermission(String, Uri)</a></code> for a specific target
 package.  The given Uri will match all previously granted Uris that are the same or a
 sub-path of the given Uri.  That is, revoking "content://foo/target" will
 revoke both "content://foo/target" and "content://foo/target/sub", but not
 "content://foo".  It will not remove any prefix grants that exist at a
 higher level.</p>
