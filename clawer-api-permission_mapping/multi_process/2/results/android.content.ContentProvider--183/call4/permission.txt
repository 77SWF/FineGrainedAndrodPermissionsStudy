<p class="note"><strong>WARNING:</strong> The framework does no permission checking
 on this entry into the content provider besides the basic ability for the application
 to get access to the provider at all.  For example, it has no idea whether the call
 being executed may read or write data in the provider, so can't enforce those
 individual permissions.  Any implementation of this method <strong>must</strong>
 do its own permission checks on incoming calls to make sure they are allowed.</p>
