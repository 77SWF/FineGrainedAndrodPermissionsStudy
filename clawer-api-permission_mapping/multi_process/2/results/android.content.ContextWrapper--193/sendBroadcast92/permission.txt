<p>Broadcast the given intent to all interested BroadcastReceivers, allowing
 an optional required permission to be enforced.  This
 call is asynchronous; it returns immediately, and you will continue
 executing while the receivers are run.  No results are propagated from
 receivers and receivers can not abort the broadcast. If you want
 to allow receivers to propagate results or abort the broadcast, you must
 send an ordered broadcast using
 <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/content/Context#sendOrderedBroadcast(android.content.Intent,%20java.lang.String)">sendOrderedBroadcast(android.content.Intent, java.lang.String)</a></code>.
