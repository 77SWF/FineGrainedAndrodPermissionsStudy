<p>Determine whether the calling process of an IPC <em>or you</em> has been granted
 permission to access a list of URIs.  This is the same as
 <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/content/Context#checkCallingUriPermission(android.net.Uri,%20int)">checkCallingUriPermission(Uri, int)</a></code>, except it grants your own permissions
 if you are not currently processing an IPC.  Use with care!</p>
