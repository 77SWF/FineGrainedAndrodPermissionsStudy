<p> If a security manager is present, and the caller's class loader is
 not null and the caller's class loader is not the same as or an ancestor of
 the class loader for the class whose class loader is requested, then
 this method calls the security manager's <code dir="ltr" translate="no">checkPermission</code>
 method with a <code dir="ltr" translate="no">RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")</code>
 permission to ensure it's ok to access the class loader for the class.
