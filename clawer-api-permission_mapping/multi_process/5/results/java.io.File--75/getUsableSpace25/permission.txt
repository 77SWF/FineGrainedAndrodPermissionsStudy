<p>Returns the number of bytes available to this virtual machine on the
 partition <a href="#partName">named</a> by this abstract pathname.  When
 possible, this method checks for write permissions and other operating
 system restrictions and will therefore usually provide a more accurate
 estimate of how much new data can actually be written than <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/java/io/File#getFreeSpace()">getFreeSpace()</a></code>.
