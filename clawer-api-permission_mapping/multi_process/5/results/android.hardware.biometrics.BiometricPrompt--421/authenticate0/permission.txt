<p>Note: Applications generally should not cancel and start authentication in quick
 succession. For example, to properly handle authentication across configuration changes, it's
 recommended to use BiometricPrompt in a fragment with setRetainInstance(true). By doing so,
 the application will not need to cancel/restart authentication during the configuration
 change.
