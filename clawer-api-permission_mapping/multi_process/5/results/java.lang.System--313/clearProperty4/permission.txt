 First, if a security manager exists, its
 <code dir="ltr" translate="no">SecurityManager.checkPermission</code> method
 is called with a <code dir="ltr" translate="no">PropertyPermission(key, "write")</code>
 permission. This may result in a SecurityException being thrown.
 If no exception is thrown, the specified property is removed.
