<p>Note that there are no permissions needed for an application to
 access this information; if your content provider requires read and/or
 write permissions, or is not exported, all applications can still call
 this method regardless of their access permissions.  This allows them
 to retrieve the MIME type for a URI when dispatching intents.</p>
