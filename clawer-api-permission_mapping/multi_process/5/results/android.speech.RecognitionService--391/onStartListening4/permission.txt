<p> If you are recognizing speech from the microphone, in this callback you
 should create an attribution context for the caller such that when you access
 the mic the caller would be properly blamed (and their permission checked in
 the process) for accessing the microphone and that you served as a proxy for
 this sensitive data (and your permissions would be checked in the process).
 You should also open the mic in this callback via the attribution context
 and close the mic before returning the recognized result. If you don't do
 that then the caller would be blamed and you as being a proxy as well as you
 would get one more blame on yourself when you open the microphone.
