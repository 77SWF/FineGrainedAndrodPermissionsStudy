<p class="note">
 Note: no permissions are required when calling this API for your own
 package. However, requesting details for any other package requires the
 <code dir="ltr" translate="no">android.Manifest.permission#PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS</code> permission, which
 is a system-level permission that will not be granted to normal apps.
 Declaring that permission expresses your intention to use this API and an
 end user can then choose to grant this permission through the Settings
 application.
