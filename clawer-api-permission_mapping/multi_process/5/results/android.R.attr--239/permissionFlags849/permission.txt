 <tr><td>costsMoney</td><td>1</td><td>Set to indicate that this permission allows an operation that
 may cost the user money.  Such permissions may be highlighted
 when shown to the user with this additional information.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>hardRestricted</td><td>4</td><td>This permission is restricted by the platform and it would be
 grantable only to apps that meet special criteria per platform
 policy.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>immutablyRestricted</td><td>10</td><td>This permission is restricted immutably which means that its
 restriction state may be specified only on the first install of
 the app and will stay in this initial allowlist state until
 the app is uninstalled.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>installerExemptIgnored</td><td>20</td><td>Modifier for permission restriction. This permission cannot
 be exempted by the installer.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>removed</td><td>2</td><td>Additional flag from base permission type: this permission has been
 removed and it is no longer enforced. It shouldn't be shown in the
 UI. Removed permissions are kept as normal permissions for backwards
 compatibility as apps may be checking them before calling an API.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>softRestricted</td><td>8</td><td>This permission is restricted by the platform and it would be
 grantable in its full form to apps that meet special criteria
 per platform policy. Otherwise, a weaker form of the permission
 would be granted. The weak grant depends on the permission.
 <p>What weak grant means is described in the documentation of
 the permissions.</p></td></tr>
