<p>Application components are normally run in a single process that
 is created for the entire application.  You can use this tag to modify
 where they run.  If the process name begins with a ':' character,
 a new process private to that application will be created when needed
 to run that component (allowing you to spread your application across
 multiple processes).  If the process name begins with a lower-case
 character, the component will be run in a global process of that name,
 provided that you have permission to do so, allowing multiple
 applications to share one process to reduce resource usage.
