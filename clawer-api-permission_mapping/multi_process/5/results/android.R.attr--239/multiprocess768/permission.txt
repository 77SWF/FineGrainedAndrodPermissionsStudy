<p>Normally the system will ensure that all instances of a particular
 component are only running in a single process.  You can use this
 attribute to disable that behavior, allowing the system to create
 instances wherever they are used (provided permissions allow it).
 This is most often used with content providers, so that instances
 of a provider can be created in each client process, allowing them
 to be used without performing IPC.
