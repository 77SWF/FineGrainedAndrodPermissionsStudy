<p>Flag indicating whether the given application component is available
 to other applications.  If false, it can only be accessed by
 applications with its same user id (which usually means only by
 code in its own package).  If true, it can be invoked by external
 entities, though which ones can do so may be controlled through
 permissions.  The default value is false for activity, receiver,
 and service components that do not specify any intent filters; it
 is true for activity, receiver, and service components that do
 have intent filters (implying they expect to be invoked by others
 who do not know their particular component name) and for all
 content providers.
