<p>If set to true, a single instance of this component will run for
 all users.  That instance will run as user 0, the default/primary
 user.  When the app running is in processes for other users and interacts
 with this component (by binding to a service for example) those processes will
 always interact with the instance running for user 0.  Enabling
 single user mode forces "exported" of the component to be false, to
 help avoid introducing multi-user security bugs.  This feature is only
 available to applications built in to the system image; you must hold the
 permission INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS in order
 to use this feature.  This flag can only be used with services,
 receivers, and providers; it can not be used with activities.
