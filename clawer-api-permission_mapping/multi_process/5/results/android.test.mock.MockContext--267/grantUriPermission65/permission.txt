<p>Grant permission to access a specific Uri to another package, regardless
 of whether that package has general permission to access the Uri's
 content provider.  This can be used to grant specific, temporary
 permissions, typically in response to user interaction (such as the
 user opening an attachment that you would like someone else to
 display).

 </p><p>To succeed, the content provider owning the Uri must have set the
 <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/R.styleable#AndroidManifestProvider_grantUriPermissions">grantUriPermissions</a></code> attribute in its manifest or included the
 <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/R.styleable#AndroidManifestGrantUriPermission">&lt;grant-uri-permissions&gt;</a></code> tag.</p>
