<p>Like <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/app/WallpaperManager#getDrawable()">getDrawable()</a></code>, but the returned Drawable has a number
 of limitations to reduce its overhead as much as possible. It will
 never scale the wallpaper (only centering it if the requested bounds
 do match the bitmap bounds, which should not be typical), doesn't
 allow setting an alpha, color filter, or other attributes, etc.  The
 bounds of the returned drawable will be initialized to the same bounds
 as the wallpaper, so normally you will not need to touch it.  The
 drawable also assumes that it will be used in a context running in
 the same density as the screen (not in density compatibility mode).
