<p>Permits an application to erase its own data from disk.  This is equivalent to
 the user choosing to clear the app's data from within the device settings UI.  It
 erases all dynamic data associated with the app -- its private data and data in its
 private area on external storage -- but does not remove the installed application
 itself, nor any OBB files. It also revokes all runtime permissions that the app has acquired,
 clears all notifications and removes all Uri grants related to this application.</p>
