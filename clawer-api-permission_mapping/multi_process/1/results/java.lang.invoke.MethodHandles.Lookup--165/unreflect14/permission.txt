<p>Makes a <a href="/reference/java/lang/invoke/MethodHandleInfo#directmh">direct method handle</a>
 to <i>m</i>, if the lookup class has permission.
 If <i>m</i> is non-static, the receiver argument is treated as an initial argument.
 If <i>m</i> is virtual, overriding is respected on every call.
 Unlike the Core Reflection API, exceptions are <em>not</em> wrapped.
 The type of the method handle will be that of the method,
 with the receiver type prepended (but only if it is non-static).
 If the method's <code dir="ltr" translate="no">accessible</code> flag is not set,
 access checking is performed immediately on behalf of the lookup class.
 If <i>m</i> is not public, do not share the resulting handle with untrusted parties.
