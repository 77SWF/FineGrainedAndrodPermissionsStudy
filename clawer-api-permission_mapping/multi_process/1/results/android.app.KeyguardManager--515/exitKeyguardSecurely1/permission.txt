   instead; this allows you to seamlessly hide the keyguard as your application
   moves in and out of the foreground and does not require that any special
   permissions be requested.
  </p><p>Exit the keyguard securely.  The use case for this api is that, after
 disabling the keyguard, your app, which was granted permission to
 disable the keyguard and show a limited amount of information deemed
 safe without the user getting past the keyguard, needs to navigate to
 something that is not safe to view without getting past the keyguard.

 This will, if the keyguard is secure, bring up the unlock screen of
 the keyguard.
