 Violations may indicate security vulnerabilities in the design of
 your app, where a malicious app could trick you into granting
 <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/net/Uri">Uri</a></code> permissions or launching unexported components. Here
 are some typical design patterns that can be used to safely
 resolve these violations:
 </p><p>
 Note that this <em>may</em> detect false-positives if your app
 sends itself an <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent">Intent</a></code> which is first routed through the
 OS, such as using <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/content/Intent#createChooser(android.content.Intent,%20java.lang.CharSequence)">Intent#createChooser</a></code>. In these cases,
 careful inspection is required to determine if the return point
 into your app is appropriately protected with a signature
 permission or marked as unexported. If the return point is not
 protected, your app is likely vulnerable to malicious apps.</p>
