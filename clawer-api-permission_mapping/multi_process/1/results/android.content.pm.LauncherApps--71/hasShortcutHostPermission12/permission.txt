<p>Note when this method returns <code dir="ltr" translate="no">false</code>, it may be a temporary situation because
 the user is trying a new launcher application.  The user may decide to change the default
 launcher back to the calling application again, so even if a launcher application loses
 this permission, it does <b>not</b> have to purge pinned shortcut information.
 If the calling launcher application contains pinned shortcuts, they will still work,
 even though the caller no longer has the shortcut host permission.</p>
