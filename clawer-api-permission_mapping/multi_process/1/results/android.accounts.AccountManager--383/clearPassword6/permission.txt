<p>Forgets a saved password.  This erases the local copy of the password;
 it does not change the user's account password on the server.
 Has the same effect as setPassword(account, null) but requires fewer
 permissions, and may be used by applications or management interfaces
 to "sign out" from an account.

 </p><p><b>NOTE:</b> If targeting your app to work on API level 22 and before,
 MANAGE_ACCOUNTS permission is needed for those platforms. See docs for
 this function in API level 22.

 Requires android.Manifest.permission.MANAGE_ACCOUNTS</p>
