<p>Marks an application exempt from having its permissions be automatically revoked when
 the app is unused for an extended period of time.

 Only the installer on record that installed the given package is allowed to call this.

 Packages start in whitelisted state, and it is the installer's responsibility to
 un-whitelist the packages it installs, unless auto-revoking permissions from that package
 would cause breakages beyond having to re-request the permission(s).
