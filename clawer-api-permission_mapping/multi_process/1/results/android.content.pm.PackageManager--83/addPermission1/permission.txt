<p>Add a new dynamic permission to the system.  For this to work, your
 package must have defined a permission tree through the
 <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/R.styleable#AndroidManifestPermissionTree">&lt;permission-tree&gt;</a></code> tag in its manifest.  A package can only add
 permissions to trees that were defined by either its own package or
 another with the same user id; a permission is in a tree if it
 matches the name of the permission tree + ".": for example,
 "com.foo.bar" is a member of the permission tree "com.foo".

 </p><p>It is good to make your permission tree name descriptive, because you
 are taking possession of that entire set of permission names.  Thus, it
 must be under a domain you control, with a suffix that will not match
 any normal permissions that may be declared in any applications that
 are part of that domain.

 </p><p>New permissions must be added before
 any .apks are installed that use those permissions.  Permissions you
 add through this method are remembered across reboots of the device.
 If the given permission already exists, the info you supply here
 will be used to update it.</p><table class="responsive">
