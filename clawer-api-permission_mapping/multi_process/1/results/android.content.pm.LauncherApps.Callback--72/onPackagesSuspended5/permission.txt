 with <code dir="ltr" translate="no">android.permission.SUSPEND_APPS</code> can do this.

 </p><p>A suspending app with the permission <code dir="ltr" translate="no">android.permission.SUSPEND_APPS</code> can
 optionally provide a <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/os/Bundle">Bundle</a></code> of extra information that it deems helpful for the
 launcher to handle the suspended state of these packages. The contents of this
 <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/os/Bundle">Bundle</a></code> are supposed to be a contract between the suspending app and the launcher.</p>
