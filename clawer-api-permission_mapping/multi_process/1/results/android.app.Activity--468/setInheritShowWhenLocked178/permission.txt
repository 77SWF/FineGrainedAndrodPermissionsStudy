<p>Specifies whether this <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/app/Activity">Activity</a></code> should be shown on top of the lock screen whenever
 the lockscreen is up and this activity has another activity behind it with the showWhenLock
 attribute set. That is, this activity is only visible on the lock screen if there is another
 activity with the showWhenLock attribute visible at the same time on the lock screen. A use
 case for this is permission dialogs, that should only be visible on the lock screen if their
 requesting activity is also visible. This value can be set as a manifest attribute using
 android.R.attr#inheritShowWhenLocked.</p>
