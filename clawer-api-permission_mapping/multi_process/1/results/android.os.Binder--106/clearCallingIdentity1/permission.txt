<p>Reset the identity of the incoming IPC on the current thread. This can
 be useful if, while handling an incoming call, you will be calling
 on interfaces of other objects that may be local to your process and
 need to do permission checks on the calls coming into them (so they
 will check the permission of your own local process, and not whatever
 process originally called you).</p>
