<p>
 This API is called by TvSettings surround sound menu when user enables or disables a
 surround sound format. This setting is persisted as global user setting.
 Applications should revert their changes to surround sound settings unless they intend to
 modify the global user settings across all apps. The framework does not auto-revert an
 application's settings after a lifecycle event. Audio focus is not required to apply these
 settings.
