<p>Control whether we should use the attached SurfaceHolder to keep the
 screen on while video playback is occurring.  This is the preferred
 method over <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer#setWakeMode(android.content.Context,%20int)">setWakeMode(Context, int)</a></code> where possible, since it doesn't
 require that the application have permission for low-level wake lock
 access.</p>
