 <li> This method can be used to allow JavaScript to control the host
 application. This is a powerful feature, but also presents a security
 risk for apps targeting <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES#JELLY_BEAN">Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN</a></code> or earlier.
 Apps that target a version later than <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES#JELLY_BEAN">Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN</a></code>
 are still vulnerable if the app runs on a device running Android earlier than 4.2.
 The most secure way to use this method is to target <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES#JELLY_BEAN_MR1">Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN_MR1</a></code>
 and to ensure the method is called only when running on Android 4.2 or later.
 With these older versions, JavaScript could use reflection to access an
 injected object's public fields. Use of this method in a WebView
 containing untrusted content could allow an attacker to manipulate the
 host application in unintended ways, executing Java code with the
 permissions of the host application. Use extreme care when using this
 method in a WebView which could contain untrusted content.</li>
 <li> JavaScript interacts with Java object on a private, background
 thread of this WebView. Care is therefore required to maintain thread
 safety.
 </li>
 <li> Because the object is exposed to all the frames, any frame could
 obtain the object name and call methods on it. There is no way to tell the
 calling frame's origin from the app side, so the app must not assume that
 the caller is trustworthy unless the app can guarantee that no third party
 content is ever loaded into the WebView even inside an iframe.</li>
 <li> The Java object's fields are not accessible.</li>
 <li> For applications targeted to API level <code dir="ltr" translate="no"><a href="/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES#LOLLIPOP">Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP</a></code>
 and above, methods of injected Java objects are enumerable from
 JavaScript.</li>
