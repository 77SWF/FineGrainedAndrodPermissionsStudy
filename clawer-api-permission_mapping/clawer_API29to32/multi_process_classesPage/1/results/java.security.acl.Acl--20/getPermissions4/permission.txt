<p>Returns an enumeration for the set of allowed permissions for the
 specified principal (representing an entity such as an individual or
 a group). This set of allowed permissions is calculated as
 follows:

 </p><ul>

 <li>If there is no entry in this Access Control List for the
 specified principal, an empty permission set is returned.

 </li><li>Otherwise, the principal's group permission sets are determined.
 (A principal can belong to one or more groups, where a group is a
 group of principals, represented by the Group interface.)
 The group positive permission set is the union of all
 the positive permissions of each group that the principal belongs to.
 The group negative permission set is the union of all
 the negative permissions of each group that the principal belongs to.
 If there is a specific permission that occurs in both
 the positive permission set and the negative permission set,
 it is removed from both.<p>

 The individual positive and negative permission sets are also
 determined. The positive permission set contains the permissions
 specified in the positive ACL entry (if any) for the principal.
 Similarly, the negative permission set contains the permissions
 specified in the negative ACL entry (if any) for the principal.
 The individual positive (or negative) permission set is considered
 to be null if there is not a positive (negative) ACL entry for the
 principal in this ACL.</p><p>

 The set of permissions granted to the principal is then calculated
 using the simple rule that individual permissions always override
 the group permissions. That is, the principal's individual negative
 permission set (specific denial of permissions) overrides the group
 positive permission set, and the principal's individual positive
 permission set overrides the group negative permission set.
