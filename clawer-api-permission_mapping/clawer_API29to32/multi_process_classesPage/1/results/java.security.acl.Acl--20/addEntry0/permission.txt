<p>Adds an ACL entry to this ACL. An entry associates a principal
 (e.g., an individual or a group) with a set of
 permissions. Each principal can have at most one positive ACL
 entry (specifying permissions to be granted to the principal)
 and one negative ACL entry (specifying permissions to be
 denied). If there is already an ACL entry of the same type
 (negative or positive) already in the ACL, false is returned.</p>
